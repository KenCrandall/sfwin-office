This font is edited from [SFWin](https://github.com/blaisck/sfwin) by [blaisck](https://github.com/blaisck).

The fonts are edited with `ttx` from [`afdko`](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko).

Items changed in the font files includes:
* `name` table (Platform ID=3, Name ID = 1&2)
* `OS/2.fsSelection` field
* `macStyle` field

These are changed to fit the family and link the Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic variant together in Microsoft Office, making the press of **`B`** and *`i`* buttons in Microsoft Office working correctly.

SF Mono Italic is a special case as the original font has Name ID 2 `Regular Italic`. The changes are reflected to other font name ï¼ˆ`name` table - Name ID 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 17 for both Platform ID 1 and 3).

Tested on _Windows 10 Pro 64-bit_.
